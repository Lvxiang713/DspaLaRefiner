This is an introduction to the output files:  
'bestStateDict.pt' contains parameters of the trained model .  
'paraDict.pt' includes the fundamental hyperparameter settings for the model.  
'perform.pt' showcases the model's performance on the dataset.  
'sta_info.pt' provides basic statistical information about the training dataset, including mean and variance.    
'S.pt' and 'Val_MCC.pt' respectively capture the information entropy of Landmarks and the MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient) variation of the model on the validation set during training.
