Prior to use, the data needs to be extracted (please note that due to the split compression, all five files need to be  uncompressed simultaneously). Upon successful extraction, you will obtain nine files, which represent nine datasets. 'data_hospital_n_m' refers to datasets obtained from the m-th random sampling of n, where n can be 01, 10, or 11, representing SWMU, NSMC, and Merged datasets, respectively. For data files with the same 'n' value, their independent test sets are consistent."
