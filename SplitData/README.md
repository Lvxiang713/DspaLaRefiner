This is a data file that has been compressed into multiple volumes using WinRAR. For detailed data information, please refer to the 'Dataset summary' section in the original article. Prior to use, the data needs to be extracted (please note that due to the split compression, all five files need to be extracted simultaneously). Upon successful extraction, you will obtain nine files, which represent nine datasets. 'data_hospital_n_m' refers to datasets obtained from the m-th random sampling of n data, where n can be 01, 10, or 11, representing SWMU, NSMC, and Merged datasets, respectively. For data files with the same 'n' value, their independent test sets are consistent."
