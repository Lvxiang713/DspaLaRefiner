These are the hyperparameter tuning results for DSpaLaRefiner and other comparative algorithms.
During the parameter optimization process for each algorithm, we conducted 12 modeling iterations for each dataset and subsequently computed the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the performance scores.  
Each folder contains three subfiles: data_hospital_01.csv, data_hospital_10.csv, and data_hospital_11.csv.
Here, "01" corresponds to the results on the SWMU dataset, "10" to the  NSMC dataset, and "11" to the merged dataset.
